Step 1: Buy  the Raspberry Pi 4 starter kit:https://www.amazon.ca/Xute-Raspberry-Pi-Model-Cortex-A72/dp/B0CDBTPJYR

Step 2: This Raspberry Pie comes with Kodi alreasy built-in. However we will flash it to have LibreELEC

Step 3: Take your Micro SD Card and plug it in your SD card reader.

Step 4:Plug the SD card reader in a USB-C port.

Step 5: Go to the Raspberry Pi OS website and download the Windows version: https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
You'll find a pink button that says "Download for Windows"

Step 6: Once you click the download button, the imager_1.8.5.exe should be downloaded in your download folder or whatever you chose.

Step 7: Once you run the .exe file, it will ask you to download the Raspberry Pi imager OS.

Step 8: Make sure to check "Run the Raspberry Pi Imager"

Step 9: When clicking on the button "Finish", the Raspberry Pi Imager should run automatically.

Step 10: In the Raspberry Pi app, you should see 3 buttons. Click the first one (Choose Device). This will prompt you to choose a Rasberry Pi. Since we have a Raspberry 4, choose that as Device.

Step 11: Click the "Choose OS" button. Go to the Media player OS and choose LibreELEC. Once chosen, you only have option and it should be "LibreELEC (RPi4)"

Step 12: In "Choose Storage" button, choose the correct micro SD card you want to flash.

Step 13: Click "Next" and wait until it's done. Once done, it will ask you to remove the Micro SD card.

Step 14: Unplug your the micro SD card and plug it into your Raspberry Pi.

Step 15: Connect the Raspberry Pi to the power and connect the HDMI cable to the wanted monitor

Step 16: On boot, click next until you arrive at the Networking menu. Configure your network if you are using wirelessly or else the Raspberry should automitcally reconize your Ethernet cable. If no network appear, try rebooting the system.

Step 17: Clicking next will take you to the Sharing and Remote Access window. Turn on SSH since it will be used to connect a computer to the Media player easily.

Step 18: Go to the system information and find the IP Address of your LibreELEC. 

Step 19: Using a Linux-based system, go to the terminal and write this command. replace libreelec_ip with the IP address from the LibreElec

ssh root@libreelec_ip

Step 20: the password is libreelec by default. Make sure you also respon yes when they ask you for conifirmation of the connection

Step 21: Next write this command to not only create the script, but also edit it.

nano log_user_activity_email.py

Step 22: Use this following code to recieve notifications of your viewing experience:

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import subprocess
import datetime
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart

# Function to send email
def send_email(subject, body, sender_email, receiver_email, password, smtp_server, smtp_port):
    message = MIMEMultipart()
    message["From"] = sender_email
    message["To"] = receiver_email
    message["Subject"] = subject
    message.attach(MIMEText(body, "plain"))
    
    with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port) as server:
        server.starttls()  # Start TLS encryption
        server.login(sender_email, password)
        server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, message.as_string())

# Get current time
now = datetime.datetime.now()
date_str = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

# Get user activity, using 'who' command
result = subprocess.run(['who'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
user_activity = result.stdout.decode('utf-8')

# Email content
subject = f"User Activity Log on {date_str}"
body = f"Activity on {date_str}:\n{user_activity}\n"

# Email credentials and server configuration for Gmail
sender_email = "your-sender-email@gmail.com"  # Replace with your Gmail address
receiver_email = "your-receiver-email@example.com"  # Replace with the recipient's email address
password = amir_sen123. "your-email-password"  # Replace with your Gmail password or app-specific password
smtp_server = "smtp.gmail.com"
smtp_port = 587  # Use 587 for TLS

# Send the email
send_email(subject, body, sender_email, receiver_email, password, smtp_server, smtp_port)

print("Activity log has been sent via email.")  # Optional: for manual run feedback

Step 23: Replace the "your-sender-email@gmail.com" with sendoesamircle.gmail.com and use the password  and make your receiever email your personal email.

Step 24: Press CTRL + O to confirm the script and press ENTER to save the files.

Step 25: Make sure you can execute this file. For this, use this command:

chmod +x log_user_activity_email.py

Step 26: use this following the

Step 3:If OSMC is not installed in your Micro SD Card, Flash it and download OSMC since it's optimized for Media Centers. OSMC comes with Kodi built-in whcih can simply your workload.

For any confusion, please follow these steps on the setup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngGkVd-_LP8&ab_channel=ETAPRIME

Step 5 : Now that everything is running smoothly, you can go ahead and explore Kodi. You can download multiple add-ons that include games, music, videos, etc. For now, YouTube and any weather apps should work without any problems. Refer to previous link to check out ways to add add-ons

Step 6: Now while having OSMC turned on, Connect your own personal Debian-based desktop. If you don't have one, download VirtualBox on your Windows based computer and then download an ISO file from Debian to run the virtual desktop independently.

Step 7: Now in OSMC, enable SSH and copy down the IP Adress.

Step 8: On your Debian Computer, go to the terminal and access the OSMC using the IP Address copies before.

Step 9: Create a .py script file that allows the OSMC to send you emails about your watch history.

Step 10: Make sure to give yourself permission to execute it for it

Step 11: Add a contab to run at 8 am everyday.
