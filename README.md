# Media Center Notification Project
Our project aims to create a Media Center using a Linux System with a Raspberry Pi. To differentiate our Media Center from others, we plan to send users an email listing the media they have watched after one day. We are primarily using LibreELEC for this project, but we have also experimented with OSMC. The notifications are made possible through Python scripts, ensuring users receive timely updates about their viewing history.

# Problem occured
In the beginning of this project, we decided to try with OSMC media Center since it had the most compatibility with scripts and everything. We felt as though not only was OSMC very old in its design. The script was also not working so we decided to scrap OSMC and try again with a new one... LibreELEC. This Media Center felt more recent and very UI friendly. However, this hasn't stopped us from having issues with the scripts.

# Modifications
We decided to finally scrap the notification part of the project since we were running to alot of hassles as mentionned in the problems occured and it was not working as intended. 



# Materiel used
For this project, we needed a Raspberry Pi 4 Starter kit that comes with a micro SD card and a SD Card reader. We always needed to buy an extra SD card since we wanted to compare both versions of Media Center and be able to review the look and feel of them.
