# Media Center Notification
# Project Description
Our project aims to create 1 or 2 Media Centers using a Linux System with a Raspberry Pi. To differentiate our Media Center from each other, we plan to send users an email listing the media they have watched after one day. We are primarily using OSMC for this project. The notifications are made possible through Python scripts, ensuring users receive timely updates about their viewing history. That being the programs they ran during in session in the OSMC. We compared their interfaces, difficulty of navigation, and programs stored.

# Materiel used
For this project, we needed a Raspberry Pi 4 Starter kit that comes with a micro SD card and a SD Card reader. We are using OSMC and LibreElec as the chosen medai centers for comparison. We always needed to buy an extra SD card since we wanted to compare both versions of Media Center and be able to review the look and feel of them.

# Further Enhancements
In the future we would like to make it so that the OSMC doesn't recognize as spam and block itself from sending a message.
